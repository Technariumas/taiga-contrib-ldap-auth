    """Deployment-specific username-to-unique-id slugification.

    Taiga requires a way to map LDAP attributes to local database
    unique identifiers. Depending on your setup, the sets of allowed
    characters for either may overlap only partially, or one may be
    a subset of another.

    Your LDAP may allow, for example, both users `User` and `user` to
    exist. Django's `slugify()` would map both to `user`. Taiga's
    `slugify_uniquely()` would map either to `user` if `user` doesn't
    yet exist in the database, and to `user-<something>` if it does -
    possibly uniquely on each login attempt.

    Edit this if your LDAP installation allows characters that Taiga
    slugs do not allow, or if substitutions need to be performed prior
    to slugification.

    NOTE that modifying code like this is ugly at best. Then again, so
    is making assumptions on what a username can be.

    NOTE also that adding or removing constraints on an already-populated
    database may result in unexpected failures.
